/**
 * System prompt + personality model for the Anime Buddy character.
 *
 * 4 PERSONALITY MODES (all strictly SFW productivity coach — no romance, no NSFW):
 *   - friendly   → default warm senpai (recommended)
 *   - sassy      → teasing, mock-exasperated, drier humour
 *   - cheerleader → high-energy, lots of emoji, celebrates everything
 *   - formal     → professional executive-assistant tone, dry, structured
 *
 * If we add character DLC later, each character ships with its own default
 * personality, but the user can override per-character.
